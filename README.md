# Bacterial Genome Variation: Some Genome Sequenceing Analysis Using Python to Find Patterns
This repo contains some Python functions that are applied to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 genome sequence (SARS-CoV2). This pre-project aims to analyze genomic data in order to gain insight into the virus's genetic makeup. Overall, this could be extanded and lead to more informative models for studying variations across different strains.
